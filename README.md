# SWAN
Possible to run the jupyter notebook using CERNs Service for Web based ANalysis, which allows the user to rung their analysis interactively through a browser that gives access to CERN storage, software stacks and computing resources. CERNBox will be your home directory so anything there, SWAN will have access to. The service uses software stacks based on cernVM file system (CVMFS) and can use any LCG software stack releases. If you know which packages you need and want to find out in which releases they are present, you can search here: https://lcginfo.cern.ch/release

To start your SWAN session now, go to:
